#100DaysOfGenerativeArt
=======================

[OCT 31st 2015 -- FEB 8th 2016]
---------------------------

Sparked by the [#The100DayProject](http://thegreatdiscontent.com/100days) post on The Great Discontent, I aim to create 100 pieces of generative art in 100 days. What is generative art? In my case it's the use of code to describe and execute procedural systems out of which complex works of art are generated. This will primarily be done on the [Processing](http://processing.org) platform with some hopeful exploration in Cinema 4D and the integration of various [data sets](https://data.nasa.gov/developer) available on the internet.
